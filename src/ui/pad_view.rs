//! **Every bad dependency row is marked, not the first**, since `[dependencies]` is a table

//! **stdout and stderr are told apart by colour and by nothing else**, and deliberately not
//! by the red every invalid thing wears: stderr is not an error, it is the other stream, so
//! it takes the palette's one warm hue.
